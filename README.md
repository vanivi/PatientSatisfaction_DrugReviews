The pharmaceutical industry continuously seeks to understand patient experiences with
medications to improve drug efficacy, safety, and patient satisfaction. Traditionally, this
understanding has been gleaned from clinical trials, post-marketing surveillance, and direct
feedback from healthcare professionals.
With the advent of online platforms, forums,
and social media, patients increasingly share their experiences with medications through reviews.
These text-based reviews are rich, unstructured data sources that offer direct insights into patient
sentiment, side effects, effectiveness, and overall satisfaction with treatment.
Machine learning, particularly NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques, can automate the analysis of this vast
amount of text data, identifying patterns, sentiments, and correlations that would be impractical to
analyse manually.
The primary goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can evaluate patient satisfaction
based on drug reviews.
